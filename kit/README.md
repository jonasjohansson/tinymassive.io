# Creators Kit

This kit contains documents and templates for different types of software. <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/tiny-massive/shared_invite/enQtNDY1MjQwMjY4NzY4LTlhZDgxZTJmZDIxOTQ0MDY5Y2I1MWQ0MDYyMjEyMmVlNGFiNDNhMTlmMmEyNzEwMTI3YWRjNzJhMzkzZGIzNjk">Join our Slack</a> for questions and creative feedback.

Upload your video and get an understanding of what it would look like on the building!

*Please note, for all realtime software, check that your app is likely to run on the hardware listed below*

## After Effects

[AfterEffectsHarpaTemplate](AfterEffects/HarpaTemplate.zip)

This project is made on After Effects CC 2017 and comes with two types of compositions; WORKING and OUTPUT. The pixel space of the Working compositions is 16x larger than the actual output. This allows you to create on a reasonable size.

**WORKING COMP**

**OUTPUT COMP**

Once you are done with Working on the creative side, you can output your work from two options:

1. Harpa2018_template_OUTPUT_Visualizer (this render can be used for the online visualiser)
2. Harpa2018_template_OUTPUT_System (this is the render for the system, your delivery format)

![](AfterEffects/HarpaTemplateGuide-4.jpg)

I recommend that you duplicate the render settings for each output. And voila!

## Controls

We will provide visitors with an arcade like control setup with 2 joysticks and 4 arcade buttons. These will be mapped like keyboard inputs, so if you want to include any of these controls into your project please refer to the diagram below. Remember that you can choose to not use these at all, or just use a few, up to you!

![](ControllerDiagramBlack.png)

```
W, A, S, D (joystick 1 up/left/down/right)
I, J, K, L (joystick 2 up/left/down/right)
Q, E (2 generic buttons mounted next to joystick 1 )
U, O (2 generic buttons mounted next to joystick 2 )
0 (Important: this button (numpad 0) should reset the game state.)
```

###Hardware###

Please ensure that if you are delivering a realtime work (Unity app, Processing, TD etc), that it will run on our target hardware:
`Macbook Pro, OSX 10.12 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3, Nvidia GT 750M`


These documents are provided for the curious and are intended to show exactly how the lights are laid out on the buildings. **Pay no attention to the codes on the diagrams**, they are for us to worry about, and some of them are wrong anyway. **Also note** our 77x13 mapping does miss some small rows, and one or two individual lights at the edges. They will remain black.
