# Creators Kit

This kit contains documents and templates for different types of software. <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/tiny-massive/shared_invite/enQtNDY1MjQwMjY4NzY4LTlhZDgxZTJmZDIxOTQ0MDY5Y2I1MWQ0MDYyMjEyMmVlNGFiNDNhMTlmMmEyNzEwMTI3YWRjNzJhMzkzZGIzNjk">Join our Slack</a> for questions and creative feedback.

## Video Visualiser

[Visualiser](../visualiser/)

Upload your video and get an understanding of what it would look like on the building!

## Templates

### Processing / Javascript

We don't offer templates for PDE or JS-files but as long as they can run on Mac and in Chrome (if Javascript) you're good.

### Unity

We have two templates: Simple and Advanced. The simple is great if you've worked with Unity a bit but isn't using it on a daily basis. Advanced has a built-in visualiser of the building, but requires a bit more knowledge. Both comes with tutorials!

**Simple** ([tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3irySxcXY4))

### After Effects

[AfterEffectsHarpaTemplate](AfterEffects/HarpaTemplate.zip)

This project is made on After Effects CC 2017 and comes with two types of compositions; WORKING and OUTPUT. The pixel space of the Working compositions is 16x larger than the actual output. This allows you to create on a reasonable size.

**OUTPUT COMP**

Once you are done with Working on the creative side, you can output your work from two options:

1. Harpa2018_template_OUTPUT_Visualizer (this render can be used for the online visualiser)
2. Harpa2018_template_OUTPUT_System (this is the render for the system, your delivery format)

I recommend that you duplicate the render settings for each output. And voila!

## Controls

The controls will be 2 joysticks and 4 arcade buttons and are yours to use in whichever way you deem fit. We will take care of transmitting control messages to your application.

```
W, A, S, D (joystick 1 up/left/down/right)
I, J, K, L (joystick 2 up/left/down/right)
Q, E (2 generic buttons mounted next to joystick 1 )
U, O (2 generic buttons mounted next to joystick 2 )
0 (Important: this button (numpad 0) should reset the game state.)
```

## Tips and Tricks

1. Keep it bold and simple. Detailed visuals might lose against pixel art for example.
2. The video content on a building this big might appear faster, be modest with the speed.
3. Negative space is the key, the more black and contrast, the better the look.
4. Using audio to animate will help compensate the lack of pixels. Beat the beat.
