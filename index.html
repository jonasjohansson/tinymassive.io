			<h2>Open call #1</h2>
			<p><em>Winter Lights Festival 2019<br>7th — 10th February</em></p>
			<p>For the very first edition of Tiny Massive you are invited to illuminate Harpa concert hall during <a href="http://www.winterlightsfestival.is/">Reykjavik Winter Lights Festival</a>. We are looking for work that cultivates a meaningful connection among people or between individuals and structures. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from the architecture of Harpa and the raw nature that surrounds it. You can apply either with video content or generative/interactive/game experiences. The selected works will be displayed during the festival.</p>

			<h3>Apply</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Application deadline: 16th of December 2018, 24:00 CET</li>
				<li><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/3H5Fq7omWalWrx252" target="_blank">Application form</a></li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Technical specifications</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Resolution Left Facade: 39x9px</li>
				<li>Resolution Right Facade: 38x13px</li>
				<li>Resolution Total: 77x13px</li>
				<li>Video Length: 2-5 minutes</li>
				<li>Video encoding: Uncompressed</li>
				<li>Video format: Quicktime</li>
				<li>Sound: Optional, but highly recommended</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For games / interactive content we expect a Mac app that runs and displays graphics on screen in the correct resolution. It's also possible to provide a Touch Designer file, ask in the Slack channel for more info.</p>
			<p>Please <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/tiny-massive/shared_invite/enQtNDY1MjQwMjY4NzY4LTlhZDgxZTJmZDIxOTQ0MDY5Y2I1MWQ0MDYyMjEyMmVlNGFiNDNhMTlmMmEyNzEwMTI3YWRjNzJhMzkzZGIzNjk">join our Slack</a> for creative discussions around your idea. We have lots of experience creating content for the building and are willing to make your contribution the best it can be!</p>
			<!-- <h4>Please note</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Due to the tiny resolution but massive size of Harpa it's important to be very considerate of contrast and pace. Subtle gradients that may be visible on a computer monitor will likely not present well on the building.</li>
				<li>Make use of the unique fact that Harpa has two facades with unique designs and resolutions.</li>
				<li>While the final resolution is tiny, you can easily work in 10x or 20x to have an easier time designing.</li>
				<li>There is no monetary reward for having your work selected. What you get in return is some great documentation and an extraordinary canvas to present your work on. We will of course make sure to post all the selected works and artists online.</li>
