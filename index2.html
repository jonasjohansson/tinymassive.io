			<p>Nordic Audiovisual Artists presents Tiny Massive, a series of architectural interventions where monumental structures are transformed into a creative canvas of light.</p>
			<p>For the very first edition of Tiny Massive you are invited to illuminate Harpa concert hall during Reykjavik Winter Lights Festival. We are looking for work that cultivates a meaningful connection among people or between individuals and structures. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from the architecture of Harpa and the raw nature that surrounds it. You can apply either with video content or generative / interactive / game experiences. The selected works will be displayed during the festival.</p>
