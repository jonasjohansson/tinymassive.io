**Experimental Game Interaction** 

[Bonkell](http://www.game-swing.com/bonkell/) - about precision and cooperation. The game consists of a series of mini-courses, each carried out by pressing an increasingly complex sequence through 12 arcade buttons built into the room’s 2 tables.  
[Line Wobbler](http://wobblylabs.com/projects/wobbler) - a one-dimensional dungeon crawler game with a unique wobble controller made out of a door-stopper spring and a several meter long ultrabright LED strip display.  
[Tiny Wings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6pT_2E5xI0) - Tap and hold the screen to make the bird fly. Use hills and valleys to gain speed and flap as long as possible.  
[SFCave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WozidC1-ASs) - The player has to navigate a winding cave filled with obstacles using just one button and precision timing. (Inspiration for Flappy Bird)
